A chatbot framework written in Go. But there's a catch, you don't need to know a lick of Go! All configurations are made in YAML files, or inside scripts written in your favorite language.

The philosophy behind flottbot is to create very simple, lightweight, "dumb" bots that interact with APIs and scripts which house a bot's business logic. The word flott comes from the German word meaning quick/speedy.
